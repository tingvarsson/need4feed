Open-source RSS reader for Android

The problem of not having your blogs, news feeds and other information feeds organized is the main target with the described software. Being able to gather, manage and get a good overview of your interests. Today there exist several sim- ilar solutions; web based such as Google Reader, desktop clients such as Reeder and smartphone applications such as Feedly. What this software will offer to its users compared to the already established names is a minimalistic interface with low overhead but still capable of giving the full-fledged RSS experience. An experience including adding your favorite feeds, categorizing them and keeping track of the latest unread posts. Making this experience easy will make the user anyone with a smartphone.

This project is performed as a part of Software Engineering, CSE406, at Hanyang University, Seoul.
